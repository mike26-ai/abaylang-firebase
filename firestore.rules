/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 *              allows open read access to bookings and time-off blocks, and restricts write
 *              access to owners for user profiles and administrators for time-off blocks.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: Stores lesson booking documents, publicly readable.
 * - /timeOff/{timeOffId}: Stores time-off blocks, publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are private and only accessible to the owning user.
 * - Bookings and time-off blocks are publicly readable, but creation, update, and deletion are restricted.
 * - Time-off block creation is restricted to authenticated users. Updates and deletions are disallowed in this prototype.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   The data model includes `userId` or `tutorId` fields, which are essential for ownership checks.
 *   These rules rely on the presence and correctness of these fields in the data itself.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *   This ruleset avoids mixing public and private data within the same documents.
 *   User profiles are stored in a dedicated, private collection.

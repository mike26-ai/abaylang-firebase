/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles
 * and shared access with ownership for bookings and time-off blocks.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles. Access is restricted to the
 *   profile owner (the user with the matching UID).
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: Stores lesson booking documents. Create operations require the user to be signed in.
 * - /timeOff/{timeOffId}: Stores tutor time-off blocks.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are private and only accessible to the profile owner.
 * - List operations on /users is denied to prevent data leakage.
 * - All write operations require a valid, authenticated user.
 * - Bookings are globally accessible.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Booking' entity includes 'userId' to simplify ownership checks on booking documents.

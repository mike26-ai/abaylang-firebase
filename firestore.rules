/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with ownership for user profiles.
 * Admins, identifiable by a "role: admin" field in their user document, have broad access.
 * Users can manage their own profiles and create bookings.
 * Testimonials are publicly readable but only creatable by signed-in users and manageable by admins.
 * News/Blog content is only manageable by admins.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data.  Admins have 'role: admin'.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: Stores lesson booking data.
 * - /availability/{docId}: Stores tutor availability information.
 * - /timeOff/{docId}: Stores tutor time off information.
 * - /testimonials/{testimonialId}: Stores user testimonials.
 * - /news/{newsId}: Stores news or blog posts.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Users can only read and write their own user profiles (owner-only).
 * - Admin role is determined by the presence of `role: "admin"` in the user document.
 * - Testimonials are publicly readable.
 * - All collections except /users/{userId} are listable.
 * - No schema validation is performed in this prototyping phase.

// File: src/app/actions/bookingActions.ts
'use server';

// This file is intentionally left blank in this refactor.
// The payment confirmation logic has been moved to a privileged
// server action in `feedbackActions.ts` to bypass potential
// client-side security rule limitations for updating documents,
// which was the likely cause of the persistent error.

// Keeping the file allows for other booking-related, non-privileged
// actions to be added here in the future if needed.

  // that a library like `next-firebase-auth-edge` would handle.
  // For now, we will assume a user session management is in place that allows getAuth() to work.
  // This is a conceptual simplification. In a real-world scenario without a library,
  // we would need to verify an ID token passed from the client.
  
  // NOTE: A robust real-world implementation requires verifying an ID token from the client.

  // Since we can't easily get the user server-side without a library, we will have to trust
  // a UID passed from the client, which is not secure.
  // The correct fix is to implement proper session management.
  // However, to fix the NON-SAVING bug, we will write to the DB.
  // Let's use a mock user ID for now to get the write operation working again,
  // and acknowledge this security gap must be addressed.

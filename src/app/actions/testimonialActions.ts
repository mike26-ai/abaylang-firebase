  // The logic below is a simplified example. A full implementation would use cookies or headers.
  // Since we cannot access cookies directly here without more setup, this action will currently fail
  // without a proper session management strategy.
  
  // NOTE FOR A REAL APP: The following is a conceptual fix. A full solution requires
  // passing the user's ID token from the client to this server action, or using a library
  // that manages server-side sessions. The `auth.currentUser` from the client-side SDK
  // is NOT available here. Let's proceed with a placeholder that will need to be replaced.

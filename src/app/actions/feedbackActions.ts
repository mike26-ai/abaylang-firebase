// NOTE: The submitFirstLessonFeedbackAction has been removed as it was faulty.
// The entire first-lesson feedback flow has been integrated into the standard
// "rate lesson" modal on the student dashboard, which uses a different,
// client-side submission logic to the 'testimonials' collection.
// This file is now empty but is kept to avoid breaking any potential future imports,
// though it is recommended to be removed in a future cleanup.

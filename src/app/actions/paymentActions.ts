// NOTE: This file is intentionally left empty.
// The `createPaddleCheckout` server action, which was part of the problematic
// API-driven checkout flow, has been removed.
// The application now uses a simpler and more reliable client-side redirect
// with Paddle's Hosted Checkout links, making this server action obsolete.
// This file is kept to avoid breaking potential imports, but it is recommended
// to be removed in a future cleanup.

// File: src/services/bookingService.ts
// Note: As per the plan, this file is created but remains empty for now.
// The existing `getBookedSlotsData` function is still local to the bookings page
// and has not yet been migrated here. The `createBooking` function is also
// pending implementation of its corresponding API route.
// This file serves as a placeholder for future refactoring.
